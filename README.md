# Motion-planning-using-Bug-Algorithm 

A 2 wheeled robot is equipped with a 2D laser range finder in order to detect obstacles in its environment. It needs to get to its charging station using a homing signal. The objective of this assignment is to perform perception using a laser range finder, and use the perceived information to avoid obstacles and navigate to the charging station. 

Bug 2 algorithm is used in this mini project. In this Bug 2 algorithm, the robot always attempts to move along the line of sight toward the goal. If an obstacle is encountered, a canonical direction is followed until the line of sight is encountered.
